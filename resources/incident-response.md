# Information Security Interview Preparation (Incident Response)

## What are the key elements of a security incident response plan?

A security incident response plan outlines the steps an organization will take when a security breach or incident occurs. The key elements include:

- **Preparation**: Identifying assets, creating a response team, and setting up necessary tools (e.g., monitoring systems).
- **Detection**: Monitoring for signs of a security incident and identifying it.
- **Containment**: Isolating affected systems to prevent the spread of the attack.
- **Eradication**: Identifying the root cause and removing the threat.
- **Recovery**: Restoring systems and data, ensuring they are free of vulnerabilities.
- **Lessons learned**: After the incident, reviewing the response and updating the plan to improve future responses.
